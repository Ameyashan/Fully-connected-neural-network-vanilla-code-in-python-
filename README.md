# Fully-connected-neural-network-vanilla-code-in-python-

Implemented a fully connnected neural network in python using just the matrix operation library
The network consists of a minimum of two hidden layers (other than the input and the output
layer).

The last layer in the neural network is be softmax (dimensions being the number of classes).
The network has the flexibility to the number of hidden layers and hidden neurons.
Network has a validation accuracy of 50%.
